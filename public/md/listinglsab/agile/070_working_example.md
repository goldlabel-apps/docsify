## Working Example (工作示例)

Everything starts with a story, so first thing it to go to [GitHub](https://github.com/listingslab-software/listingslab/issues/new?template=story.md) and create one. 

In the GitHub world it's called and Issue, which makes it sound like a bug, but bugs are a type of issue, not the other way around

Basic rule of thumb is; If you can write a good story, you will get a good outcome
